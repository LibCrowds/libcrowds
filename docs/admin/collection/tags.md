# Tags

Tags are used to help users more easily location the types of project that
they're interested in. The available tags for all projects within a collection
are managed via this section.

For each tag type created a new filter will be added to
the  collection's main projects page page (shown on the left in the screenshot
below).

## Creating

To add a new tag click the 'Add a tag type' button at the top of the page. In
the modal that appears enter a name for the tag type (e.g. Location), choose a
colour and set an initial list of tags (e.g. London, Plymouth etc.), then
click 'OK'.

Tag types can be edited or removed by locating them in the table and clicking
the 'Edit' or 'Remove' buttons, respectively.
