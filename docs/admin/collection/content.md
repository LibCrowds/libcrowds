# Content

A set of markdown editors are provided here for modifying content for the About,
Projects and Data pages. Changes are made in real-time, although you may have
to refresh your browser to see them.

For the About page, navigation items will be generated from each level two
header, created in Markdown by using the ## tag, for example:

```
## Contact

This is the contact details section.
```

These navigation items can be clicked to scroll the users window to the top
of that section.
